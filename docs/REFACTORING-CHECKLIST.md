# 🔧 File Refactoring Checklist

## Pre-Refactoring Analysis

### ✅ File Size Assessment
- [ ] Run file size analysis script
- [ ] Identify files over 300 lines
- [ ] Prioritize files over 500 lines
- [ ] Mark critical files over 800 lines

### ✅ Complexity Analysis
- [ ] Count number of components in file
- [ ] Identify state management complexity
- [ ] Note number of useEffect hooks
- [ ] Check for mixed concerns

### ✅ Dependency Mapping
- [ ] List all imports and exports
- [ ] Identify shared utilities
- [ ] Map component relationships
- [ ] Note external dependencies

## Refactoring Strategy

### 🎯 Component Extraction
- [ ] Identify logical component boundaries
- [ ] Extract UI components first
- [ ] Move business logic to hooks
- [ ] Create focused, single-purpose components

### 🎯 Hook Extraction
- [ ] Extract state management logic
- [ ] Create custom hooks for effects
- [ ] Move API calls to dedicated hooks
- [ ] Separate form handling logic

### 🎯 Utility Extraction
- [ ] Move helper functions to utils
- [ ] Extract constants to separate files
- [ ] Create type definitions
- [ ] Organize shared logic

## Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Preparation
- [ ] Create backup branch
- [ ] Document current functionality
- [ ] Set up testing environment
- [ ] Plan component structure

### 2️⃣ Extraction Process
- [ ] Start with smallest components
- [ ] Extract one component at a time
- [ ] Test after each extraction
- [ ] Maintain original functionality

### 3️⃣ Optimization
- [ ] Remove duplicate code
- [ ] Optimize imports
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Improve component props

### 4️⃣ Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all extracted components
- [ ] Verify UI remains unchanged
- [ ] Check responsive behavior
- [ ] Test all user interactions

## Quality Assurance

### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] Each component has single responsibility
- [ ] Props are properly typed
- [ ] Components are reusable
- [ ] Code is well-documented

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Proper memoization where needed
- [ ] Optimized imports
- [ ] Reduced bundle size

### ✅ Maintainability
- [ ] Clear file structure
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Good separation of concerns

## Post-Refactoring

### 📊 Metrics Verification
- [ ] File sizes reduced appropriately
- [ ] Component count is reasonable
- [ ] Complexity is manageable
- [ ] Performance is maintained/improved

### 📝 Documentation
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document new file structure
- [ ] Update README if needed

### 🔄 Continuous Monitoring
- [ ] Set up file size monitoring
- [ ] Regular complexity reviews
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Code quality checks

## Success Criteria

### ✅ File Size Targets
- Main components: < 300 lines
- Page components: < 200 lines
- Utility files: < 150 lines
- Hook files: < 100 lines

### ✅ Functionality Preservation

- [ ] All animations working
- [ ] Responsive design intact
- [ ] Performance not degraded

### ✅ Developer Experience
- [ ] Easier to understand code
- [ ] Faster development cycles
- [ ] Better debugging experience
- [ ] Improved testability
